# imgProcessing.c - Simple Neural Network for Image Processing

Welcome to `imgProcessing.c` â€“ a lightweight neural network designed for basic image processing. This simple neural network takes an 8-bit black and white photograph, converts it into a matrix data set, and learns to reproduce a similar image through training.

## Key Features:

- **Image-to-Matrix Transformation:** Converts an 8-bit black and white photograph into a matrix data set suitable for neural network processing.
- **Image Reproduction:** Trains the neural network to reproduce a similar image as the input through a learning process.

## Usage:

1. Ensure your input image is an 8-bit black and white photograph.
2. Customize the parameters and training process in ```main.c``` based on your image data.
3. After run the code you can see the ```Best value for maximum epochs``` and substitute the value into the variable for better training of the neural network
4. Compile ```gcc main.c``` and run the code ```a.exe path-to-image``` :-)

Happy coding!
